            "description": " If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthroic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calyso. You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations sent laying board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, excet for one tiny, vexing realization: it's imossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calyso, Sedaris sets his formidable owers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny - it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's writing has never been sharer, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unaralleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made u of more ast than future. This is beach reading for eole who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumour joke. Calyso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet - and it just might be his very best.",

But uon discovering how these remarkable substances are imroving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy eole coming to gris with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to exlore the landscae of the mind in the first erson as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into the exerience of various altered states of consciousness, along with a e dee into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of sychedelic theraists. Pollan sifts the historical record to searate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the Sixties, when a handful of sychedelic evangelists catalyzed a owerful backlash against what was then a romising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, iHow to Change Your Mindi is a triumh of articiatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the griing account of a journey to an exciting and unexected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our lace in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \"mental travelogue\" is not just sychedelic drugs, but the eternal uzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both struggle and beauty, we can do our best to be fully resent and find meaning in our lives.",

            "description": " bbInstant#160;iNew York Timesi#160;Bestsellerbr br Legendary venture caitalist John Doerr reveals how the goal-setting system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) has heled tech giants from Intel to Google achieve exlosive growthmdash;and how it can hel any organization thrive. bbbr br In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-u whom he'd just given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrereneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business lan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on riorities while keeing their team on track. They'd have to know when to ull the lug on losing roositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their rogressmdash;to measure what mattered.br br Doerr taught them about a roven aroach to oerating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (#x22;the greatest manager of his or any era#x22;) drove the best-run comany Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture caitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty comanies. Wherever the rocess was faithfully racticed, it worked.br br In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those to-riority goals will be attained with secific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transarent to the entire organization. br br The benefits are rofound. OKRs surface an organization's most imortant work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They kee emloyees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire comany. Along the way, OKRs enhance worklace satisfaction and boost retention.br br In iMeasure What Mattersi, Doerr shares a broad range of first-erson, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and exlosive growth that OKRs have surred at so many great organizations. This book will hel a new generation of leaders cature the same magic.",
